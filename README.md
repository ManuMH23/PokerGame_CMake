# GitHub Actions Workflow

## Purpose

The GitHub Actions workflow is designed to automate the build and testing process for the project. It ensures that the codebase is always in a working state and helps catch any issues early in the development process.

## Instructions

1. **Triggering the Workflow**: The workflow is triggered automatically on push and pull request events. You don't need to manually start it.
2. **Build and Test**: The workflow will check out the repository, set up the C++ environment, and run the build commands.
3. **Status**: You can check the status of the workflow in the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository. It will show whether the workflow succeeded or failed.
